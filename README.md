## Installation

Download the ZIP-folder. After extracting, double-click the `ðŸ’Žsketch-tailwind-plugin.sketchplugin` file. 

## Usage

### Creating your theme
The plugin gets it's info from the Layer Styles and Text Styles. At this point it picks up:
- colors
- font-families
- text-sizes. 

When you export the theme it saves a file with your theme in a variable `theme` and there's an export available in the file.

### Importing your theme
Import the `theme.js` file in to your `tailwind.js` configuration file. 
```
import theme from './theme';
```
Using the spread operator at the end of each property you can add the colors, fonts and font-sizes to your config.
```
let colors = {
  'transparent': 'transparent',
  ...
  ...theme.colors,
```
